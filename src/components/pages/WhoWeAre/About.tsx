              In September 2013, inspired by the profound legacy of Professor
              Byaraa Chimid, our organization was established with a singular,
              powerful mission: to continue the vital work of constitutional
              education and legal scholarship.
              <br />
              <br />
              Emerging from the vision of a distinguished statesman who was
              instrumental in drafting Mongolia&apos;s constitution, the Chimid
              Foundation represents a commitment to preserving and advancing the
              democratic principles that form the cornerstone of our society.
              <br />
              <br />
              Our story is one of continuous learning, rigorous research, and
              unwavering dedication to empowering citizens through
              constitutional knowledge.
